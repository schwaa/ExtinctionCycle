# .clinerules for Phaser 3 Game (Web + Mobile)

- This is a Phaser 3 game built with JavaScript (ES6 modules) targeting web browsers and mobile devices.
- User Phaser 3 best practices when planning and coding.
- Use single quotes for strings and 2-space indentation. Always end statements with semicolons.
- Game scenes are in `/src/scenes/` (e.g., PreloadScene, MainScene). Each scene extends Phaser.Scene.
- Assets (images, audio) are in `/assets/`. Load them in the preload() method of scenes.
- Keep game logic modular: utility functions go in `/src/utils/`.
- Optimize for mobile: avoid heavy loops or unneeded DOM manipulation outside Phaser’s canvas.
- Before suggesting changes, ensure the game runs with `npm start` (web) or check mobile build compatibility.
- Suggest Phaser best practices unless I specify otherwise.
- Do not edit `/dist/` or `/node_modules/`—those are generated or managed externally.
- If adding assets, remind me to update the preload logic and check file sizes for mobile performance.
- Propose changes in small, testable chunks (e.g., one scene or feature at a time).
- Try to search for the simple solution first, we want the simplest approach that will work
- Don't duplicate where data is stored, have one source of truth for data values.
- If code is being duplicated, look to make a reusable and testable function
- when finished a task stop working. don't do more than one task at a time.
- Do not edit .nvmrc 
- Never edit a file name Grid.js
- Prefer Phaser's Registry system over custom state management solutions
